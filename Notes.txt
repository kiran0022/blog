1:46:54 --> learn markdown, rehype, hightlight, react markdown...  and make the copybutton component error to tostify notification rather than logging the errir

1.59.50 --> answer for -> why created seprate table for blog contents

2.00.00 --> generating type from supabase to vscode with login access token (google it for more)
            https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/generating-types

2.12.30 --> either can be users table auth table [supabase dashboard rls policy doubt]

2.34.16 --> why bind method with the function

2.41.35 --> eror while edit blog is clicked redirected with the dynamic route from blog.ts (the url seems to be ok problem with something)
            Server Error 
            Error: Invariant: cookies() expects to have requestAsyncStorage, none available.

         **** solution 2.42.48 -> call the supabase function for every time ****                 


2.54.50 --> policy missing occured serveral stages check it 

3.05.19 --> no error but the blogtable that lists the total blogs was invisible because we are using the readBlog()->blog.ts same function for both the views pov blog page and out dashboard blogs lists
                  solution- creating another function serpatelly to avoid that mistake 3.07.19

3.08.14 --> supabase function creation for the read only policy update

 const { ["content"]:excludedKey, ...blog} = data
    what is excludedKey in this also this is similar to const{content, ...blog} = data -> which is omiting the content data and using the remaining

3.22.20 --> isr strategy maybe for revalidate through the api

3.24.00 --> Feauture not working ( not published should be able to visible through the view button in the dashboard but its redirected )

3.30.50 --> supabase dashboard change for the blog content protected security











NEED TO LEARN ==>
 
$ learn how different from the mongodb to fetch data from the database 
   just like triggering when its triggered the value is storing in the database hwo that works in supabase
      know the supabasework flow how to write function and triigers why are that beem used 


$ check bg radient effect in config  or globalcss


publish trigger functino not working
when it is called something anonyms happens like while creating blog the  "column ispublish not found error" occurs also the entire part of the blog liist is not rendered
 --> fixed this in glitch way like insted of this is_publish() or is_admin() i used like  is_admin() or is_publish()
